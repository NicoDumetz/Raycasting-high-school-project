# Raycasting Project

The Raycasting Project is a terminal-based project where I aimed to utilize the raycasting technique similar to Doom to create a semi-3D game experience.

Raycasting is a technique used in video games to simulate a 3D effect in a 2D environment, such as a terminal. Unlike traditional 3D rendering which requires intensive computation, raycasting simulates depth by calculating the distance between the player and objects in the game using rays.

In this technique, a ray is cast from the player's position in various directions. Wherever the ray hits a wall, the distance is calculated and used to draw a vertical column on the screen. By overlaying these columns, we get a 2D representation of the world in perspective, giving the illusion of depth.

This approach allows for the creation of pseudo-3D games with simple yet effective graphics, reminiscent of classic games like Doom or Wolfenstein 3D.

# Overview

In this game, navigate through a maze, collect keys to unlock doors, and reach the exit. Keys are scattered throughout the maze, each unlocking a corresponding door. Strategic key collection is crucial for progressing through the labyrinth efficiently.


# Installation Pygame

To install Pygame, you can follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python is Installed**: Pygame is a Python library, so you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Pygame using pip**: Once Python is installed, you can install Pygame using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

# How to run

```bash
python3 main.py
```
